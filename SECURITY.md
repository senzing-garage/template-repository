## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email <support@senzing.com>.
Discussion of vulnerabilities will be done via email to avoid public exposure of the vulnerability.

In general, project dependencies are updated within 30 days of the dependency's release.


FIXME:

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
